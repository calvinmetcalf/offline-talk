  Offline first maps with Calvin Metcalf
<notes>Hello everyone and welcome to my talk</notes>
</div>
<div>
  Special spatial techniques
  <notes>
    The origional version of this talk was goign to be very map focused
  </notes>
</div>
<div>
  Syncing tile caches and optimizing indices and etc!
  <notes>With things like background syncing tiles and what not</notes>
</div>
<div><img src="c.jpg"/>
  Sorry
  <notes>This is not that talk</notes>
</div>
<div>
  spatial isn't special
  <notes>Methods for making all sites work offline are good enough for maps </notes>
</div>
<div>
  Defs
  <notes>this is offline first in the sense of mobile first, it won't work offline the first time you go to it, you need connection that first time, it's the idea of designing with offline access as the first priority </notes>
</div>
<div>
  Service Workers
  <notes>Service workers are your bread and butter of making things work offline</notes>
</div>
<div>
  Seriously just service workers
  <notes>If you do nothing else then service workers, but what are they </notes>
</div>
<div>
  a worker
  <notes>they run in seperate threads and communicate via message passing</notes>
</div>
<div><img src="cb1.jpg"/>with a cache
  <notes>with access to a request cache (which is like a box)</notes>
</div>
<div>
  able to intercept http requests
  <notes>service workers have access to apis that allow them to intercept and replace all http requests</notes>
</div>
<div>
  including other sites
  <notes>this includes other sites, so you can use them on tiles</notes>
</div>
<div>
  you can also precache stuff
  <notes>you have flexibility to precache, cache on demand, and even modify the requests or responses</notes>
</div>
<div>so how does it work
  <notes>when you first go to a site it installes the service worker</notes>
</div>
<div>
  one worker for all tabs
  <notes>this only happens once for a given 'scope' so multiple tabs get a single worker</notes>
</div>
<div>
  multipe pages
  <notes>this could be for all pages in a given scope</notes>
</div>
<div>
  event based with promises
  <notes>events are emitted that can be listened for for thinks like:</notes>
</div>
<div>
  install
  <notes>when the service worker gets installed, this is when you'd precache stuff</notes>
</div>
<div>requests
  <notes>when any http request is made, this allows you to intercept it and maybe fulfill it from a cache</notes>
</div>
<div>
  upgrade
  <notes>when a new version of the service worker is available</notes>
  <notes>so how can they be used</notes>
</div>
<div>
  fallback
  <notes>at the very basic a service worker can allow you to just check for responses in a cache and then possible give that back in loo of a request</notes>
  <notes>youf can (if you want) put the result of a network request into the cache</notes>
</div>
<div>push notifications
  <notes>the service worker can be woken up even if the page isn't open (with permision)</notes>
</div>
<div>
serverless<notes>you can for an advanced case somewhat use a service worker in place of a worker to generate some of the content</notes>
</div>
<div><img src="dd.jpg"/>
  <em>danger</em>
  <notes>But I'm not sure I'd rely on ALL sites neccisarily supporting them </notes>
</div>
<div>
  Firefox and Chrome <em>only</em>
  <notes>only the non default browsers corently support workers, so I'd not design yoru site to rely on it</notes>
  <notes>also of note</notes>
</div>

<div>
  <em>must</em> be https
  <notes>it must be in https, this shouldn't be a problem</notes>
</div>
<div>
  let's encrypt
  <notes>as you really don't have any exuse these days, espeicially as geolocation also requires https these days</notes>
